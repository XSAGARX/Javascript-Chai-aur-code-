If one side is a string, the other operand is also converted to a string and they are concatenated.
If they are both BigInts, BigInt addition is performed. If one side is a BigInt but the other is not, a TypeError is thrown.
Otherwise, both sides are converted to numbers, and numeric addition is performed.
